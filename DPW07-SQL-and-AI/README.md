# DPW07 - Azure SQL ❤️ Open AI

## Vector 101

You can use the scripts in this folder to have an introduction to vectors in Azure SQL, embeddings and similarity search.

You need to have an embedding model deployed in Azure OpenAI and then make sure to replace the following placeholder you'll find in the scripts, with the correct values for your deployment:

- `$OPENAI_URL$`: for example, *https://my-ai-test.openai.azure.com*
- `$OPENAI_KEY$`: for example, *1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef*
- `$OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT_NAME$`: for example, *text-embedding-3-small*

## Retrieval Augemented Generation sample

The script used to add the present sample to the samples available to the AI Search demo is the following:

```sql
exec dbo.add_sample '
{
    "name": "Live360 2024 Orlando Demos", 
    "description": "Demos used at the Live360 2024 Orlando conference",
    "notes": "",
    "url": "https://github.com/yorek/live360-2024-orlando",
    "details": {

        "languages": ["T-SQL", ".NET", "C#"],                
        "services": ["Azure SQL"],
        "conferences": ["Live360 2024 Orlando"]
    }
}
